export const title = "Multiple Sites";

A key difference to other react frameworks is that a snowstorm project can consist of multiple sites.
For a simple setup, you will probably only have a single site. Here, your pages can be defined a `pages` folder you create at the root of your project.

As your project grows, you might want add more sites, for example you might want to host your documentation on `docs.example.com`.
Sharing your components, configs and assets between multiple projects in the same repository is a first-class supported feature with snowstorm.

To add new sites, simply create a new folder calld `sites`.
In this folder, create sub-folders named after the different sites you want to develop, e.g:

<pre className="language-tree">
{/* <!-- prettier-disable --> */}
├── sites
│   ├── admin.example.com
│   │   ├── components
│   │   └── pages
│   ├── docs.example.com
│   │   ├── components
│   │   └── pages
│   └── example.com
│       ├── components
│       └── pages
├── package.json
└── snowstorm.config.ts
</pre>

Now, you can keep your `snowstorm.config` like before or even configure plugins, routes, etc for each site individually.

<br />
`snowstorm.config.ts`

```ts
import { SnowstormConfig } from "@snowstorm/core/server";

export const Config: SnowstormConfig = {
  sites: [
    {
      domain: "docs.example.com",
      build: {
        plugins: [
          // plugins applied only to docs.example.com
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
  site: {
    build: {
      plugins: [
        // plugins applied to all sites
      ],
    },
  },
};
```
