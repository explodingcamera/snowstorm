# Deploying your website

Deploying your website is as easy as running `$ npx snowstorm export`.
For convenience, you can also add a export script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@snowstorm/www",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "snowstorm dev",
    "export": "snowstorm export",
    "start": "snowstorm start"
  }
}
```

If you have any issues in export mode, you can also test out a production build using the start command which might help reveal more errors.
