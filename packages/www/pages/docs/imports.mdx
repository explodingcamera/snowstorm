# Importing Libraries

Importing any library on npm should work, however be warned that a lot of `common.js` based projects (code using `require()`) use weird and unsupported tricks and global variables, which can't be easily translated to es modules.

Thankfully, most recent and popular projects have switched to es-modules too.
