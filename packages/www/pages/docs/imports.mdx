# Importing Libraries

Importing any library on npm should work, however be warned that a lot of `common.js` based projects (code using `require()`) use weird and unsupported tricks and global variables, which can't be easily translated to es modules.

Thankfully, most recent and popular projects have switched to es-modules too.

## Common Issues

### SSR error: Error require() of ES Module ... not supported

This happens for some packages when running in production mode (`snowstorm start` or `snowstorm export`). This is due to the way esm packages are externalized to speed up builds.
To fix this, add the package to the `noExternalize` field in your build config.

`snowstorm.config.ts`

```tsx
import { SnowstormConfig } from "@snowstorm/core";

export const Config: SnowstormConfig = {
  site: {
    build: {
      noExternal: [
        "@pognetwork/proto",
        "champ-wasm",
        "d3-array",
        "d3-time-format",
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

### Issues when importing Webassembly modules

Use the following plugin that we provide:

```bash
npm i @pognetwork/vite-plugin-wasm-pack
```

```tsx
import { SnowstormConfig } from "@snowstorm/core";
import vitePluginWasmPack from "@pognetwork/vite-plugin-wasm-pack";

export const Config: SnowstormConfig = {
  site: {
    build: {
      noExternal: ["your-wasm-module"],
      plugins: [vitePluginWasmPack([], ["your-wasm-module"])],
    },
  },
};
```

### `load-html.js` not found

Check the previous errors, something has prevented snowstorm from compiling a javascript bundle.
