## Caveats

- Dynamic routing is not supported for exported sites yet. Alternatively, you can specify routes on build-time, more on that <Link to="/docs/dynamic-routes">here</Link>.

## Alright, let's actually get started now!

Getting started with snowstorm takes less than a minute and doesn't any require confusing `init` commands:

```bash
# install the required dependencies
$ npm install -S @snowstorm/core @snowstorm/cli react@18 react-dom@18 typescript

# (optional) enable scss support:
$ npm install -S sass

# this folder will contain all webpages
$ mkdir pages
$ echo 'export const Index = () => <h1>Hello World</h1>' > pages/index.tsx

# (optional) enable typescript support
$ echo '{ "extends": "@snowstorm/core/tsconfig.base.json" }' > tsconfig.json

# start the development server
$ npx snowstorm dev
```
