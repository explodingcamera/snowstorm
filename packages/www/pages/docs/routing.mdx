export const title = "Routing";

Routing is based on the filename of a page:

```
index.tsx                   => GET /
page.tsx                    => GET /page
users/[userID].tsx          => GET /users/example
users/[userID]/profile.tsx  => GET /users/example/profile
```

To do routing in your Application, we provide the following APIs:

```tsx
import {Link, useLocation} from "@snowstorm/code";

// ..
const [location, setLocation] = useLocation();

// ..
<Link to="/"><a>home</a></Link>
<Link to="/help"><button>help</button></Link>
```
