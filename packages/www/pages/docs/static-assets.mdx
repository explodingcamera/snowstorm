export const title = "Static Assets";

To include static assets such as videos and images in you website, you can simply import them and you will get the corresponding url:

`pages/index.tsx`

```tsx
import image from "./../assets/image.png";
export const Index = () => <img src={image} />;
```

Note that the folder can be any folder, however it should be somewhere inside of your root directory.
