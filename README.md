## The lightning-fast and minimalist React Framework
### Snowstorm is the new React Framework which - through the power of [ES-Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and Server Side Rendering - makes web development fun again<br><br>

# > Important: Snowstorm isn't Production-Ready yet

### **Key Features**
* Develop faster, with a dev server that starts up in less then 200ms thanks to [snowpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack)
* Soon: Drop-in replacement for `next.js` using `@snowstorm/next-compat`
* Out-of-the-box support for everything you will ever need
* Minimal: no added bloat, loads nothing more than what you use
* Versitile: supports everything from complex server side code to blazing fast, javascript free static websites
* Lots of small quality-of-life improvements
